1. SQL databases are relational databases i.e data is organised into tables that are linked, while in NoSql, data is organised
into objects.
2. SQL databases use the Structured Query Language(SQL) to perform CRUD operations while NOSQL does not use SQL.Instead,
the system traverses through the objects while performing CRUD operations.

If you need a Database to store structured data and use the powers and maturity of SQL and all the SQL echo-system and your system
is transaction-intensive, go for SQL.

If you need is more around something more specific needs such as data caching, indexing or specific storage like linked data
or unstructured data go for NoSQL
