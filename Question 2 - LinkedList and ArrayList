ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses array.
If any element is removed from the array, all the bits are shifted in memory.
Arraylist maintain indices like arrays. So if want more frequent get operations than put then arraylist is best to go. 

Uses
****
ArrayList can be used to store  records eg names of people and also makes it easy to retrieve the names using its indices.
ArrayList is also important in creating a collection of items E.g creating a java object containing a user's details and
then you can declare an ArrayList of type user object to store these collections.


LinkedList is better for manipulating data.Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses doubly
linked list so no bit shifting is required in memory.
LinkedList maintain pointers to elements. you can't to a specific index like in arraylist. But the advantage here in linkedlist
is that they don't need to shift back and forth like in arraylist to maintain continues indices. So get operations in linkedlist
are costly as you would have to go through pointers to reach your elements. But put operations are good as compared to arraylist.
you just need to connect to pointers and that's it.

uses
****
Linked list is effecient in an operation like changing the spelling of a name in the list
