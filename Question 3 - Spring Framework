Advantages of Spring Framework
******************************

1.Spring provides an abstraction layer on existing technologies like servlets, jsps, jdbc, jndi, rmi, jms and Java mail etc.,
to simplify the develpment process.

2.Spring comes with some of the existing technologies like ORM framework, logging framework, J2EE and JDK Timers etc,
Hence we don’t need to integrate explicitly those technologies.

3.Spring framework includes support for managing business objects and exposing their services to the presentation tier
components, so that the web and desktop applications can access the same objects.

4.Spring application can be used for the development of different kind of applications, like standalone applications,
standalone GUI applications, Web applications and applets as well.

5.Spring provides a light weight container which can be activaed without using webserver or application server.
